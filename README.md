## Project Description
Project Summary:

Our project addresses the rapidly growing issue of e-waste by creating an interactive platform that encourages efficient waste management and public engagement. The objective is to increase e-waste recycling rates by combining technology and user participation.

**Key features include:**
**1. Image Upload & Pickup Scheduling**:
Users can upload images of their e-waste and schedule a pickup at their convenience.

**2. ML-Powered Image Validation:**
The system uses a machine learning model to validate uploaded images, ensuring they classify as e-waste.

**3. Automatic Request Forwarding:**
Verified e-waste requests are forwarded to the selected recycling center for pickup.

**4. Interactive Education Module:**
A Unity-based module spreads awareness about e-waste disposal through engaging content and visuals.

**5. AI Chatbot for Assistance:**
Integrated AI chatbot answers user queries, helps with image uploads, scheduling pickups, and provides recycling info.

**6. Automated Waste Detection:**
Public cameras use machine learning to detect e-waste, automatically alerting authorities with geo-tagged data.

**7. Real-Time Alerts:**
Waste hotspots are tracked with GPS, sending real-time alerts to authorities for quick responses.

**8. Public Reporting App:**
Users can submit e-waste images via a mobile app for verification and action.

**9. Gamified Rewards System:**
Users earn points for reporting e-waste, completing recycling challenges, and participating in educational activities.

**10. Seamless AI, ML & Geolocation Integration:**
The platform combines AI, ML, and GPS tracking to efficiently address e-waste problems while engaging the community.
